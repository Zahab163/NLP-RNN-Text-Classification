# 🧠 NLP RNN Text Classification

This project implements a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** using TensorFlow to perform **sentiment analysis** on text data.  
It was developed in Google Colab and exported here for sharing and reproducibility.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Classify text (e.g., movie reviews) as positive or negative.
- **Dataset:** IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset (via TensorFlow Datasets).
- **Model:** RNN with LSTM layers for sequential text classification.
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## ⚙️ Features
- Text preprocessing and encoding using TensorFlow Datasets.
- RNN model with stacked LSTM layers.
- Training and validation with accuracy/loss visualization.
- Sentiment prediction on custom text inputs.
